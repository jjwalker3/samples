<div>3D Printing Technologies Workshop.</div>

<div><strong>Presenter:</strong></div>

<div>Yasser Al-Hamidi - Mechanical Engineering Program's Laboratory Manager at Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar.</div>

<div><strong>Summary:</strong></div>

<div>3D printing and other 3D technologies are changing the way in which we conduct our day to day life. Over the course of three hours, Mr. Yasser Al Hamidi, the Mechanical Engineering Laboratories Manager at Texas A&M University in Qatar will be talking about different 3D technologies available in the market, in particular 3D printing technologies. Mr. Al Hamidi will also show case a wide range of applications of such technologies in industry, health, fashion, and education. If you want to learn and understand more about the 3rd industrial revolution, and how to make use of 3D technologies at home with your kids or in the hospital with your patients, this is a good startup.</div>

<div>3D Printing Technologies Workshop.</div>

<div><strong>Presenter:</strong></div>

<div>Robert Laws - Web &amp; Media Services Librarian at Georgetown University in Qatar.</div>

<div><strong>Summary:</strong></div>

<div>Modern web development has come a long way from using basic text editors, writing long CSS files, and laborious debugging. With today's web development workflows, creating, process, testing, and debugging websites is easier than ever. This workshop will show how to set up a web development workflow using Node, Sass, and the automated task runner Gulp.js - with Adobe Brackets as our code editor.  Participants will learn how to setup a web development workflow and then create a small project using a modern javascript library like AngularJS or Ember.js to create a web application. Participants will see how the web development workflow speeds up the development process. Participants will also get a view of the power of modern javascript libraries to build professional level web applications.</div>

<div>Emerging Technology Tools and Trends in Academic Libraries.</div>

<div><strong>Presenters:</strong></div>

<div>Dr. Nicole Johnston - Lecturer in Library and Information Studies at University College London-Qatar.</div>

<div>Wumi Akinade - eAccess Technician at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar.</div>

<div><strong>Summary:</strong></div>

<div>This presentation will discuss emerging technology trends and tools and their impact on academic libraries and the role of librarians in this ever changing technological environment. Recently reports such as the Horizon Report 2015: Library edition have highlighted the impact that technology will have in the future on the role of librarians in academic libraries. Technology and tools such as social media, mobile technology, data visualisation, 3D and Makerspaces will all play a role in defining the future of our profession. This presentation will discuss the role technological tools will play in the future of libraries and librarians both at an international and local level including showcasing how library patrons at one academic library in Qatar see the future role of technology in the library.</div>

<div>Big Data in Biomedicine – Challenges and Opportunities for Libraries.</div>

<div><strong>Presenter:</strong></div>

<div>Mirko von Elstermann - Biosciences Information Librarian at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar.</div>

<div><strong>Summary:</strong></div>

<div>The concept of Big Data refers to data that cannot be handled by simple tools such as spreadsheets or other traditional database formats. The reason for this are three features of Big Data – volume, velocity and variety. Some areas of science, such as particle physics, have been known since long for their huge data output; in biomedicine, the quantity of experimental data has increased exponentially in more recent years, in areas such as genome sequencing, analyses of brain connectivity, or epidemiological and public health studies. Besides quantity, speed of data generation and their diversity have also grown rapidly, owing to technical advances like automated sequencers or to the multi-faceted approaches required by many biomedical experiments.  My talk discusses recent strategies and techniques of libraries and librarians to manage Big Data in a way that maximizes their use for the scientific community.

<div>Museums in Context: Identity Curation, Technology and Forces of Momentum.</div>

<div><strong>Presenter:</strong></div>

<div>Pamela Erskine-Loftus - Director of The Media Majlis at Northwestern University in Qatar.</div>

<div><strong>Summary:</strong></div>

<div>Museums are often reported in international press as being new to the Gulf States, however this belies the almost 60 year history of these institutions in the region, and the extensive private collections and other collecting practices which take place. The increased growth in museum creation, and the re-imagination of existing institutions, over the last ten years has received considerable coverage, particularly the regeneration of national museums, and the creation of large art museums. What these discussions omit is analysis of the rapid changes within museums in the Gulf, what this means for visitors and users, and how these and similar institutions align with national objectives and desired educational outcomes. This presentation will discuss some aspects of this ‘future museum type’ in light of the rapid museum development in the region, uses of technology, and how these museums support visitors in their own curation of identity.</div>

<div>Copyright, Licensing and Virtual Learning Environments.</div>

<div><strong>Presenter:</strong></div>

<div>David Hughes - Copyrights &amp; Licensing Librarian at Qatar National Library.</div>

<div><strong>Summary:</strong></div>

<div>The evolving relationship between the academic library and the virtual learning environment (VLE) is examined from the copyright and licensing perspective.  VLEs (also known as “Learning Management Systems”) are web-based platforms that manage and facilitate the exchange of digital content for academic courses.  VLEs play an increasingly important role in the teaching function at universities. Moreover, in terms of the dissemination of electronic resources the distinction between traditional taught-in-classroom courses and online courses is narrowing. The role of librarians in interacting with faculty and student users of the VLE to support teaching and learning is multifaceted and evolving.  A key aspect of the presentation is the implications of copyright and licensing in selecting and using licensed electronic content on a VLE.   The interplay of electronic “course reserves” (content assigned by the instructor as recommended or mandatory reading for which a shorter loan period applies), interlibrary loans (ILL), copyright and licensing, and the VLE are examined with a view to assisting librarians and educators more effectively manage library resources and VLEs.</div>

<div>Your LMS, Data Analytics and Student Success - Solve the Puzzle.</div>

<div><strong>Presenter:</strong></div>

<div>Sharon Hollinsworth - Director of Education Computing Support at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar.</div>

<div><strong>Summary:</strong></div>

<div>Your LMS is more than a fancy curriculum content delivery system.  Provide your students with the guidelines and expectations in your course by defining a syllabus, rubrics and learning outcomes.  Every assignment and quiz can be linked to specific learning outcomes and this data can be used to empower your learners.  Why wait until the end of the course?  Give students data supported feedback on their progress and provide early intervention so that they can master the skills in your course and be successful on your campus.  The inquisitive minds of today’s learners do not fit with our old school receptor type knowledge delivery.  These digital natives have expectations and we need to use our LMS skills to meet those needs.  Let’s start to solve the puzzle.</div>

<div>3D Printing Technologies &amp; Trends.</div>

<div><strong>Presenter:</strong></div>

<div>Yasser Al-Hamidi - Mechanical Engineering Program Laboratory Manager at Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar.</div>

<div><strong>Summary:</strong></div>

<div>3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing is changing the way we conduct our day to day life, because it allows end users to do much of their own manufacturing rather than engaging in trade to buy products from other people and corporations. 3D printers are nowadays capable of producing parts in different colors and from multiple materials, and will continue to improve to a point where functional products can be produced. 3D printing with its fast technological improvements will influence soon energy use, waste reduction, customization, product availability, medicine, art, construction and sciences.</div>
